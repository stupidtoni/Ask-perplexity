# Ask-perplexity

If you want to make the app open with a command and not as an exe, download the files in the main folder and make a shortcut:
> The target: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c npm start

> Start in: "{the location of the folder with the all the files of this project}"


I found it faster to open it like that, for some reason the exe was taking a bit longer to start.

If you did all of this, everything should work fine. If it doesnt, make an issue and provide a video of you doing what i have said and it not working. Good luck!

Also i provided the icon so you can, you know, have an icon for the shortcut.
