# Ask-perplexity

If you want to make the app open with a command and not as an exe, download the files in the main folder and make a shortcut:
> The target: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c npm start
> "{the location of the folder with the all the files of this project}"
I found it faster to open it like that, for some reason the exe was taking a bit longer to start.
